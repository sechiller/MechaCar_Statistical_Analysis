## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

*Ground Clearance and Vehicle Length provide a non-random amount of variance.

*The slope of the linear model is not considered to be 0 because the p value is considerably less than the assumed significance level of 0.05%

*The linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the p value is low and the r-squared value is high. However, there are several values that are not significant which means there is evidence of Overfitting.
